# Sketch Template for Favicons
A template to create all favicons for modern websites using Sketch.

## What's Included

### Sketch File

The sketch file includes 24 favicons that can all be exported at once or individually. The demo icon and text are saved as a symbol so once the symbol is updated then it automatically updates all favicons so the images can be created quickly.

### HTML Code

There is a commented file so you can learn what each block does and one without comments to quickly update to use on your website. If you would like to learn more about the code then read the following pages:
